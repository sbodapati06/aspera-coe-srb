### Welcome to Faspex - As easy as email

Faspex is a centralized transfer solution that enables users to exchange files with each other using an email-like workflow. 

Faspex enables high-speed transfers using IBM Aspera’s proprietary FASP protocol, fully utilizing available network bandwidth to maximize speed while preserving control and security.<br>
User-uploaded files and folders are sent to, stored on, and downloaded from Aspera transfer servers.

Use Faspex to send files and folders to other members of your organization. Sending files and folders through Faspex is similar to sending an email, however many transfer solutions aren’t fit for large or growing business as many have maximum file size limits (Ex: Gmail’s file size limit of 15MB).
